Information
===========

S3det implements a methods for detecting both subfamilies and positions with a "subfamily-dependent"
conservation pattern (SDPs, Specificity Determining Positions) in multiple sequence alignments.
These subfamilies and their corresponding SDPs have been shown to be related to functional
specificity, and they complement the fully conserved positions as predictors of functionality
from sequence information.

S3det is based on a vectorial representation of the MSA in a high dimensional space. A
reduction of this space by Multiple Correspondence Analysis (Greenacre, 1984) produces a
low dimensional space preserving most of the original information but filtering main sources
of noise. Proteins with similar sequences will cluster together in similar regions of this
reduced space. A similar vectorial treatment for the individual residues (instead of 
full-length proteins) produces an equivalent space where the residues with most of the 
information for explaining the separation of the subfamilies go to the same regions of the
space where these subfamilies are.

The selection of the optimal number of reduced dimensions to be kept is a crucial step to
strike the most favourable balance between relevant and noisy information. This is a main
advantage of multivariate approaches. S3det makes use of the non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank
Sum Test (Miller & Miller, 1998) to assess the statistical confidence of each dimension for
being informative.

Once both proteins and residues spaces have been optimally decomposed in their main relevant
sources of variation, S3det supplies, by means of an unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm,
an automated identification of the putative groups of proteins that will be regarded as different
functional subfamilies within the MSA.

After these protein subfamilies have been established, they are linked with the residues space
in order to automatically assign the set of residues that uniquely characterizes each group.
Thereafter, SDPs are predicted as those positions whose residues characterize a number of
groups spanning the whole alignment (these groups being either isolated subfamilies or merged
ones). SDPs are considered as the functional specificity determinining residues within the
protein family.

The input for the program is a multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format. There is not
a minimum number of sequences and/or positions for the program to run, but it is
recommended having at least 12 sequences and 25 non gappy positions, with enough functional
diversity between them. An example can be seen in the attached "S3det_example.fasta" file

The results of the program TOTALLY depend on the multiple sequence alignment used. S3det
implements 2 options to filter gappy columns and outliers sequences. For example, the syntaxis
to filter columns with more than 20% of gaps and sequences with a similarity to anyother less
than 35% would be the following:
>./S3det_v2.2.exe -i aln_file(FASTA) -o output_file -g 20 -s 35
However, S3det doesn't perform any sequence redundancy filtering, and this should be previously
considered by the user. In case the user has not an own criteria, the recomended value for
running S3det is 95% of sequence redundancy filtering.

S3det can also deal with an external functional binary classification, instead of performing
an automatic clustering of the sequences. In this case, an external functional classification
has to be provided in the form of a matrix of "functional binary membership" between proteins
(by rows) and functions (by columns). The format of this file can be seen in the attached
"s3det_example.func" file. The first line contains the name of the functions to be studied, separated
by <TAB>. Following lines code in a binary way the presence (1) or absence (0) of the corresponding
function column for every protein in the alignment. CAUTION: Every protein has to be assigned
to some function. NOTICE: FUZZY CODING is accepted, that is, coding the protein's membership
of a given function with a number between "0" and "1" (e.g. "0.25"). This allows you to provide
a certain probability of membership. In case of fuzzy coding, a given protein should belong to
more than one function in such a way that the sum of its values is "1"(e.g. 0.25 for function_A,
0.75 for function_B and 0 for function_C). WARNING: missing values are not accepted. The syntaxis
to run a supervised analysis should include the "-f" option, eg:
>./S3det_v2.2.exe -i aln_file(FASTA) -o output_file -f function_file

To parse the output to obtain the SDPs, type in shell

> grep "^RE:" output_file

And you obtain a list with the following fields:
			RE:
			<WHITE_SPACE>
			Position_in_the_original_alignment
			<TAB>
			Average_rank
			<TAB>
			Number_of_groups_within_the_complete_partition
			<TAB>
			Partition_based_on:
			<WHITE_SPACE>
			List_of_clusters(rank_within_cluster) separated by <WHITE_SPACE>

For instance
	RE: 103	1	2	Partition_based_on: Cluster_2(rank:1) Cluster_1_3(rank:1)
	RE: 152	1	2	Partition_based_on: Cluster_1(rank:1) Cluster_2_3(rank:1)

	RE: 14	3	3	Partition_based_on: Cluster_1(rank:1) Cluster_2(rank:1) Cluster_3(rank:7)


The complete set of labels used in order to parse the output are

II: Internal Information
UI: User Information
OUT: Name of outlier sequence
SC: Stable Clusters
    If (SC=="NO") -> "UI: No stable cluster results have been found: Best solution found only 'x' times out of 'y' iterations searching for 'z' groups" (and program ends)
GD: Group diversity.
    If (GD=="NO") -> "UI: There is not enough group diversity to perform the analysis" (and program ends)
CL: Line belonging to clustering of sequencies (subfamilies): Names and (int) values starting in "1"
PR: Any SDP? 
    If(PR=="NO")  -> "UI: There are no positions predicted to be important for the group segregation" (and program ends)
RE: SDPs predicted and the corresponding list of subfamilies groupings upon which they are based
CN: Any conserved position?
    If(CN=="NO")  -> "UI: There are no conserved positions at conservation_threshold % of identity"
CP: Conserved positions


Additionally, if program is executed using the verbose option (-v) -for instance:
./S3det_v2.2.exe -i aln_file(FASTA) -o output_file -v
a number of (hopefully self explaining) additional outputs for expert users will be printed.

An example can be seen in the attached "S3det_example.output_unsupervised" and "S3det_example.output_supervised" files:

Example
========

./S3det_v2.2.exe -i S3det_example.fasta -o S3det_example.output_unsupervised 
./S3det_v2.2.exe -i S3det_example.fasta -o S3det_example.output_supervised -f S3det_example.func

==================
For advanced users 
==================

Advance users can run S3det using "-v" verbose option and use the following "labes" to parse the output with grep:

	SeqCoord  : Sequence Coordinates in 1st to 10th principal axes
	ResCoord  : Position-AminoAcid Coordinates in 1st to 10th principal axes
	ClusCoord : Cluster-Center-of-masses Coordinates in 1st to 10th principal axes
	CS        : All alternative clustering solutions consistently found
	RCS       : Summary of the number of residues assigned to a cluster
	RCL       : Residues selected as specific for a given cluster of sequences (SDPs will be calculated based on these lists)
	RCM       : Matrix summarizing for each position in the alignment the ranking of their residues for each cluster
